### Hejsa ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner! I used to dabble in .NET stuff, namely in Unity3D - but nowadays I'm mostly working with Angular, besides the occasional dive into React or flutter. 

Most of the tech industry would probably label me as a Frontend Engineer but I do enjoy some degrees of automation work, and AR/VR development still has a special place in my heart. Other than that, huge fan of working in very agile environments, especially where teams are not afraid to throw away the aspects of e.g. Scrum that slow them down.

I currently work at INGKA (which is the main digital subsidiary of IKEA), helping them build an in house application for settlements which will help the company save a lot of euro-bux. See more on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathiassiig/)
