### Hejsa ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner! I'm mostly working with Angular, besides the occasional dive into React or flutter. I used to dabble in .NET stuff, namely in Unity3D but that's a thing of the past for me.

I currently work at INGKA (which is the main digital subsidiary of IKEA), helping them build an in house application for settlements which will help the company save a lot of euro-bux. See more on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathiassiig/)
